Displaying the characters of a 4x4 keypad on a dot matrix with the help of 74HC595D ICs.
At first, we take the binary numbers of the characters from the website of https://xantorohara.github.io/led-matrix-editor/ 
I connect the bases of the ICs to the dot matrix sequentially. And we must be careful to put a resistor on the dot matrix columns to prevent the LEDs from burning
